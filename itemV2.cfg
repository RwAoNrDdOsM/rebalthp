[h2]Changes for Stagger:[/h2]
[list] 
[*]Mainstay removed: the talent is conceptually weak and without a complete rework, or nerfing to competitors, will always be realistically inferior to smiter and enhanced power
[*]Bulwark buffed: 10% damage bonus now applies to all damage types and duration has been increased to 5 seconds. The intent here is to improve the supportive niche and make it an adequate alternative option for that playstyle.
[*]Enhanced Power buffed to 10%
[*]Assassin no longer applies on crits
[*]Smiter unchanged
[/list] 

Talent spread/distribution has been adjusted to two sets, varying by career:
[b]Set 1: [/b] EP, Smitter, Assassin
[B]Set 2: [/b] EP, Smiter, Bulwark.
Distribution:
[b]Set 1: [/b] Merc, Huntsman, RV, Slayer, WS, HM, Shade, SotT, WHC, BH, Zealot
