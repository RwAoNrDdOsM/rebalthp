title = "THP & Stagger Talents Rebalance";
description = "This mod is an attempt to rebalance thp and stagger talents (lvl 5 and lvl 15 talent rows). All of the changes have been playtested by a few people in developing it, but more feedback is needed. These changes are very much so not set in stone and all feedback is appreciated

[h2]Changes for THP:[/h2]
Vanguard (thp on stagger), Reaper (thp on cleave), Bloodlust (thp on kill), Regrowth (thp on heashot/crit)

THP Talent spread/distribution has been adjusted to three sets, varying by career:
[b]Set 1:[/b] Vanguard, Reaper, Bloodlust: [u]Merc, FK, GK, IB, Zealot, UC[/u]
[b]Set 2:[/b] Vanguard, Reaper, Regrowth: [u]Huntsman, RV, OE, WHC, BW, Pyro[/u]
[b]Set 3:[/b] Reaper, Bloodlust, Regrowth: [u]Slayer, Waystalker, Handmaiden, Shade, SotT, BH[/u]

[list]
[*]Changed the amount of thp you recieve from enemies when using bloodlust (see below).
[*]Changed the amount of thp you recieve from critcal hits to 1.5 and headshots to 3.5, critical headshots being 5, when using Regrowth.
[*]The hand of shallya trait has been replaced with the heal share talent.
[*]Fixed getting unlimited thp on Vanguard when using shield slams. (approx. 8 thp limit)
[*]Fixed Vanguard not proccing when you killed an enemy which is staggered, cleave unchanged.
[*]Fixed getting thp on corpses when shotgun bashing, shield slamming and fire sword heavies and similar attacks. (which is something that would be in live)
[/list]

[h2]Changes for Stagger:[/h2]
Stagger Talent spread/distribution has been adjusted to two sets, varying by career:
[b]Set 1: [/b] Smiter, Assassin, EP
[B]Set 2: [/b] Smiter, Bulwark, EP
Distribution:
[b]Set 1: [/b] Merc, Huntsman, RV, Slayer, WS, Shade, SotT, WHC, BH, Zealot, Pyro
[B]Set 2: [/b] FK, GK, IB, Engi, HM, BW, UC
[list] 
[*]Mainstay removed: the talent is conceptually weak and without a complete rework, or nerfing to competitors, will always be realistically inferior to smiter and enhanced power
[*]Bulwark buffed: 10% damage bonus now applies to all damage types and duration has been increased to 5 seconds. The intent here is to improve the supportive niche and make it an adequate alternative option for that playstyle.
[*]Enhanced Power buffed to 10%
[*]Assassin no longer applies on crits
[*]Smiter unchanged
